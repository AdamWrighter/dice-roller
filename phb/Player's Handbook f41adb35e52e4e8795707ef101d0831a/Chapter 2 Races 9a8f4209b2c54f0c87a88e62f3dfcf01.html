of Dungeons &amp; Dragons — Waterdeep, the Free City of Greyhawk, or even uncanny Sigil, the City of Doors — overwhelms the senses. Voices chatter in countless different languages. The smells of cooking in dozens of different cuisines mingle with the odors of crowded streets and poor sanitation. Buildings in myriad architectural styles display the diverse origins of their inhabitants.</p><p id="09d4176d-5d9d-44cc-8330-7bdc6630ab38" class="">And the people themselves — people of varying size, shape, and color, dressed in a dazzling spectrum of styles and hues — represent many different races, from diminutive halflings and stout dwarves to majestically beautiful elves, mingling among a variety of human ethnicities.</p><p id="68a4a6fd-e434-4457-8544-43363588875f" class="">Scattered among the members of these more common races are the true exotics: a hulking dragonborn here, pushing his way through the crowd, and a sly tiefling there, lurking in the shadows with mischief in her eyes. A group of gnomes laughs as one of them activates a clever wooden toy that moves of its own accord. Half-elves and half-orcs live and work alongside humans, without fully belonging to the races of either of their parents. And there, well out of the sunlight, is a lone drow — a fugitive from the subterranean expanse of the Underdark, trying to make his way in a world that fears his kind.</p><h1 id="d80f74b7-0a8b-4156-8dd3-1cf552af0744" class="">Choosing a Race</h1><p id="5a790308-069b-4fa6-aafa-8812afcc3d98" class="">Humans are the most common people in the worlds of D&amp;D, but they live and work alongside dwarves, elves, halflings, and countless other fantastic species. Your character belongs to one of these peoples.</p><p id="987e035e-577f-43d7-ba89-78d15ef74265" class="">Not every intelligent race of the multiverse is appropriate for a player-controlled adventurer. Dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans are the most common races to produce the sort of adventurers who make up typical parties. Dragonborn, gnomes, half-elves, half-orcs, and tieflings are less common as adventurers. Drow, a subrace of elves, are also uncommon.</p><p id="d941cea0-20ca-4cbf-a692-c34194b1fcb9" class="">Your choice of race affects many different aspects of your character. It establishes fundamental qualities that exist throughout your character’s adventuring career. When making this decision, keep in mind the kind of character you want to play. For example, a halfling could be a good choice for a sneaky rogue, a dwarf makes a tough warrior, and an elf can be a master of arcane magic.</p><p id="3de629ea-9548-4b6a-96bc-81ce4574d6fa" class="">Your character race not only affects your ability scores and traits but also provides the cues for building your character’s story. Each race’s description in this chapter includes information to help you roleplay a character of that race, including personality, physical appearance, features of society, and racial alignment tendencies. These details are suggestions to help you think about your character; adventurers can deviate widely from the norm for their race. It’s worthwhile to consider why your character is different, as a helpful way to think about your character’s background and personality.</p><h1 id="7f4fa9dc-86e9-4916-8846-b7c4c4e186cf" class="">Racial Traits</h1><p id="705710cb-7903-47d7-98b6-b3f80f6f3c3e" class="">The description of each race includes racial traits that are common to members of that race.

This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.</p><h2 id="afc32a39-f175-4d00-998c-7000f42f7e0a" class="">Alignment</h2><p id="c28ef914-fee7-4220-9994-fa8187f67773" class="">Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry.

Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently.

Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk.</p><p id="73614ab5-ef2a-4ae4-8c1a-123f4aed7456" class="">Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.</p><h2 id="a9029b87-a84e-45bd-a1b6-6fdcf04f4222" class="">Long Memory, Long Grudges</h2><p id="7a1fa3b3-7208-4dcb-b28b-4cf368498d8b" class="">Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.</p><p id="0f51f897-e92a-4bd5-a314-363e33df7b67" class="">Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don’t abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.</p><p id="6e8e2933-1725-4282-b9e2-90e9362ef20c" class="">Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf’s entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf’s hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</p><h2 id="81fa2d33-2ffd-441a-9592-5f7fe292f067" class="">Clans and Kingdoms</h2><div id="666a8b67-041e-48ed-86ff-2c760fa3bc55" class="column-list"><div id="5b8ceb6b-84be-4f06-80ca-9a2ded05a34c" style="width:50%" class="column"><figure id="125800f5-1669-4ecf-b535-f358a06feac7" class="image"><a href="https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/615/300/275/dwarf2.png"><img src="https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/615/300/275/dwarf2.png"/></a></figure></div><div id="e9d4f966-1346-4a10-9fe7-972746f4c0cf" style="width:50%" class="column"><p id="9d7edc0f-ebb8-433c-a543-a932cb52b399" class="">Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can’t find in their mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.</p></div></div><p id="026f09ad-afe2-43b2-8dc3-a434ebc40b0b" class="">The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves, and invoke their ancestors’ names in oaths and curses. To be clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.</p><p id="b2c1c753-6d1c-4f66-9eb7-ad3768870a04" class="">Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers.

Other dwarves are driven by the command or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek to restore a clan’s lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within the clan after having been exiled. Or a dwarf might search for the axe wielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field of battle centuries ago.</p></div><div id="18d4396f-72f0-469b-ac99-06dacc013dfe" style="width:50%" class="column"><figure id="1b8e3b20-93d4-4753-9995-52e2ffdfb422" class="image"><a href="https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/618/250/292/dwarf1.png"><img src="https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/618/250/292/dwarf1.png"/></a></figure></div></div><figure class="block-color-gray_background callout" style="white-space:pre-wrap;display:flex" id="5733a8d3-5e63-4630-b3d4-b60a561c7431"><div style="font-size:1.5em"><span class="icon">💡</span></div><div style="width:100%"><strong>SLOW TO TRUST</strong>
Dwarves get along passably well with most other races. “The difference between an acquaintance and a friend is about a hundred years,” is a dwarf saying that might be hyperbole, but certainly points to how difficult it can be for a member of a short-lived race like humans to earn a dwarf’s trust.

<em><strong>Elves.</strong></em> “It’s not wise to depend on the elves. No telling what an elf will do next; when the hammer meets the orc’s head, they’re as apt to start singing as to pull out a sword. They’re flighty and frivolous. Two things to be said for them, though: They don’t have many smiths, but the ones they have do very fine work. And when orcs or goblins come streaming down out of the mountains, an elf’s good to have at your back. Not as good as a dwarf, maybe, but no doubt they hate the orcs as much as we do.”

<em><strong>Halflings.</strong></em> “Sure, they’re pleasant folk. But show me a halfling hero. An empire, a triumphant army. Even a treasure for the ages made by halfling hands. Nothing. How can you take them seriously?”

<em><strong>Humans.</strong></em> “You take the time to get to know a human, and by then the human’s on her deathbed. If you’re lucky, she’s got kin — a daughter or granddaughter, maybe — who’s got hands and heart as good as hers. That’s when you can make a human friend. And watch them go! They set their hearts on something, they’ll get it, whether it’s a dragon’s hoard or an empire’s throne. You have to admire that kind of dedication, even if it gets them in trouble more often than not.”</div></figure><h2 id="6e9f1632-e990-4060-b7d3-0a76747df3e1" class="">Dwarf Names</h2><p id="58a645a5-bb96-49d8-b656-dea1436f35bf" class="">A dwarf’s name is granted by a clan elder, in accordance with tradition.

Four slender spires rose from the city’s corners like glistening spindles, their brilliant white stone marbled with shining silver. Graceful arches, swooping from spire to spire, soared through the air. Crafted by ancient dwarven metalsmiths, they were strong enough to hold the weight of an army, yet they appeared so delicate that a bird lighting on them might overthrow the balance. These glistening arches were the city’s only boundaries; there was no wall around Qualinost. The elven city opened its arms lovingly to the wilderness.

Were it not for one renowned exception, the race of drow would be universally reviled. To most, they are a race of demon-worshiping marauders dwelling in the subterranean depths of the Underdark, emerging only on the blackest nights to pillage and slaughter the surface dwellers they despise. Their society is depraved and preoccupied with the favor of Lolth, their spider-goddess, who sanctions murder and the extermination of entire families as noble houses vie for position.

Yet one drow, at least, broke the mold. In the world of the Forgotten Realms, Drizzt Do’Urden, ranger of the North, has proven his quality as a good-hearted defender of the weak and innocent. Rejecting his heritage and adrift in a world that looks upon him with terror and loathing, Drizzt is a model for those few drow who follow in his footsteps, trying to find a life apart from the evil society of their Underdark homes.

Drow grow up believing that surface-dwelling races are inferior, worthless except as slaves. Drow who develop a conscience or find it necessary to cooperate with members of other races find it hard to overcome that prejudice, especially when they are so often on the receiving end of hatred.</div></figure><h2 id="71766ec3-b8ed-45e2-981f-dd349c32b018" class="">High Elf</h2><p id="aff6af87-4c16-4766-b6ad-75f4fc9967e6" class="">As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic.

They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon.

<em><strong>Dwarves.</strong></em> “They’re stout folk, stalwart friends, and true to their word. Their greed for gold is their downfall, though.”

<em><strong>Elves.</strong></em> “It’s best not to wander into elven woods. They don’t like intruders, and you’ll as likely be bewitched as peppered with arrows. Still, if an elf can get past that damned racial pride and actually treat you like an equal, you can learn a lot from them.”

The scales of his face had grown paler around the edges, but Clanless Mehen still looked as if he could wrestle down a dire bear himself. His familiar well-worn armor was gone, replaced by violet-tinted scale armor with bright silvery tracings. There was a blazon on his arm as well, the mark of some foreign house. The sword at his back was the same, though, the one he had carried since even before he had found the twins left in swaddling at the gates of Arush Vayem.

For all her life, Farideh had known that reading her father’s face was a skill she’d been fortunate to learn. A human who couldn’t spot the shift of her eyes or Havilar’s would certainly see only the indifference of a dragon in Clanless Mehen’s face. But the shift of scales, the arch of a ridge, the set of his eyes, the gape of his teeth — her father’s face spoke volumes.

But every scale of it, this time, seemed completely still — the indifference of a dragon, even to Farideh.

But at least the relative largeness of the apartment gave Burgell room to pack in all his gnome-sized gear. The front room was his workshop, and it contained a bewildering miscellany of tools: hammers, chisels, saws, lockpicks, tinted lenses, jeweler’s loupes, and jars of powdered and shredded ingredients for casting spells. A fat gray cat, the mage’s familiar, lay curled atop a grimoire. It opened its eyes, gave Aeron a disdainful yellow stare, then appeared to go back to sleep.

“The same.” The newcomer’s bearded face split in a wide grin. He held open his arms and, before the dwarf could stop him, engulfed Flint in a hug that lifted him off the ground.

Many half-elves, unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in the adventuring life.</p><h2 id="dcfc4395-d1a7-4a42-8cc9-77b0b7e14bb5" class="">Of Two Worlds</h2><p id="89449609-d92f-4150-858f-4871775f3096" class="">To humans, half-elves look like elves, and to elves, they look human. In height, they’re on par with both parents, though they’re neither as slender as elves nor as broad as humans. They range from under 5 feet to about 6 feet tall, and from 100 to 180 pounds, with men only slightly taller and heavier than women. Half-elf men do have facial hair, and sometimes grow beards to mask their elven ancestry. Half-elven coloration and features lie somewhere between their human and elf parents, and thus show a variety even more pronounced than that found among either race. They tend to have the eyes of their elven parents.</p><h2 id="b66f5306-6a44-4ca7-b2cd-9886427f141d" class="">Diplomats or Wanderers</h2><div id="25cfffa9-3378-4f1d-b7e3-3678adc0601e" class="column-list"><div id="71216002-ce2d-4a97-ab51-642a85dfcc8a" style="width:37.5%" class="column"><figure id="305f3b5f-c7ae-463c-ab1e-79bcd99d177c" class="image"><a href="https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/641/250/400/half-elf1.png"><img src="https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/641/250/400/half-elf1.png"/></a></figure></div><div id="22c035d7-5047-457b-8e06-038248f85b81" style="width:62.5%" class="column"><p id="f3868e2d-495f-46e0-a074-a0b1dbe07362" class="">Half-elves have no lands of their own, though they are welcome in human cities and somewhat less welcome in elven forests.

Others, in contrast, throw themselves into the thick of society, putting their charisma and social skills to great use in diplomatic roles or as swindlers.</p></div></div><figure class="block-color-gray_background callout" style="white-space:pre-wrap;display:flex" id="2a3fb88f-639f-48d3-bc98-5a121f4cdcf8"><div style="font-size:1.5em"><span class="icon">💡</span></div><div style="width:100%"><strong>EXCELLENT AMBASSADORS</strong>

He usually rose before most of his warriors, since he had a strong streak of human blood in him, and he found the daylight less bothersome than most of his tribe did. Among the Bloody Skulls, a warrior was judged by his strength, his fierceness, and his wits. Human ancestry was no blemish against a warrior — provided he was every bit as strong, enduring, and bloodthirsty as his full-blooded kin. Half-orcs who were weaker than their orc comrades didn’t last long among the Bloody Skulls or any other orc tribe for that matter. But it was often true that a bit of human blood gave a warrior just the right mix of cunning, ambition, and self-discipline to go far indeed, as Mhurren had. He was master of a tribe that could muster two thousand spears, and the strongest chief in Thar.
